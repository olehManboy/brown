Overview
========

Brownie is a python framework for deploying, testing and interacting with ethereum smart contracts.

.. note:: This project relies heavily upon Web3.py. This documentation assumes a basic familiarity with it. You may wish to view the `Web3.py docs <https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`__ if you have not used it previously.

Functionality
=============

Brownie has three main uses:

* **Deployment**: Automate the deployment of many contracts onto the blockchain, and any transactions needed to initialize or integrate the contracts.
* **Testing**: Write unit tests in python and evaluate test coverage based on stack trace analysis. We make *no promises*.
* **Interaction**: Use the Brownie console to interact with your contracts on the main-net, or for quick testing in a local environment.
