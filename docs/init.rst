Initializing a New Project
==========================

To initialize a new brownie project, type ``brownie init``. This will create the following folders:

* contracts: .sol files associated with the project
* deployments: .py files to deploy contracts
* environments: data files for persitent environments
* test: .py files for unit testing

It will also create a file ``brownie-config.json`` in the project's root folder, which contains the brownie configuration information for the project.
